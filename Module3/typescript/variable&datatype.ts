//there is two way to declare  vairable in type script first is using let
// second is using var keyword 
var amount = 10;
let bal = 20;
console.log("value of amount = "+amount);
console.log("value of bal = "+bal);
//var and let are both used for function declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.

//we can also declare variable variable by its data type 
var num1:number;

num1 = 30;
console.log(num1);
var teststring :string = "this is tops tech";
var flatvariabel :number  = 23.5;

//Hear number data type works for both float and interger type storege 
// if we assigne integer value then it will works as integer type 
// and if we assign float value so it will work for float type
